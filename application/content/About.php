            <h4>About: My Journey to Today...</h4>
            <p>Moved to the Baltimore/DC area back in 2007 to attend college at UMBC. Graduated in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in Information Systems.</p>
            <p>During my time at school, I completed two internships, one at a non-profit in downtown Baltimore and the other in Syracuse NY working for a University Hospital both doing development. Both helped grow my knowledge of numerous languages, enhanced my work ethic, and provided me with an amazing experience.</p>
            <p>The day after graduating I landed a job at an aerospace technology company for 4 years and devleoped numerous software products and sites.</p>
            <p>Now working full-time for another company in downtown Washington as part of a development team.</p>
